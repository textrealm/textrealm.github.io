## Overview 

TextRealm is a web application where UH students can easily buy and sell their textbooks to other UH students. We hope to 
develop a working application, in which the student can login to their account, or sign up for an account, fill out the 
necessary information for their profile, and can buy textbooks by searching for textbooks based on their ISBN number and 
contacting the seller, or they can set up offers for textbooks that they plan to sell. 

We plan to implement the following items:

* A landing page
* A rating system that allows buyers and sellers to rate each other based on their experience
* A profile page that lists the textbooks that the user is selling
  * Includes user's name, a description, a way for other users to contact them, and profile picture
* User will be able to apply tags and notes to their entries, such as the class it can be used for, details on the condition, 
and any other information related to the textbook
